# Stay-Alive-Simulation
A simulation using evolutionary algorithms and autonomous steering.

To run:

Click the clone or download dropdown in github
Download as zip
Extract onto your desktop
Run the index.html file
Refresh your browser a few times if it doesnt begin running immediately.
Modify the sliders to change different variables and effect the simulation.
You can click reset on the dashboard to restart the simulation with the current settings you selected.

Notes:
The agents spawn with a unique genetic code that contains four different values which influence their behavior in the environment.
They have a value for desire for food and poison.  They also have values for percieving the food and poison in the environment.
They move in straight lines and the desire for food or poison modifies their vectors towards or away the target
  once it is within their sight radius.
There is also a chance they will clone themselves and retain the same dna values.  There is also mutation which happens rarely and slightly   modifies the values of the agent at cloning.  More healthy agents have twice the chance to clone themselves.
